#  TT Motor Differential Drive Robot Base

This repository contains the 3D design for a modular, differential-drive mobile robot base. Engineered in **Onshape**, this chassis is optimized for standard **TT Motors** (Geared DC Motors) and features a stable, low-center-of-gravity design for robotics experimentation.

##  Key Features

* **Precision TT Motor Mounts:** Custom-designed brackets to securely house standard yellow geared DC motors without slipping.
* **Optimized Weight Distribution:** Motor and battery placement are calculated to provide maximum traction to the drive wheels.
* **Modular Mounting Points:** The main plate features a pre-drilled grid pattern for easy mounting of microcontrollers (Arduino/ESP32) and motor drivers (L298N).
* **Cloud-Based CAD:** Designed entirely in **Onshape**, allowing for easy parametric adjustments to chassis width or motor positioning.
